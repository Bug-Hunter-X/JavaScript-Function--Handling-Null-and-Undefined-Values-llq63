# JavaScript Function: Null and Undefined Handling

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript error involving null and undefined values. The initial code handles null values correctly, but fails to address undefined values which leads to unexpected behavior or errors.

The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version, showing how to handle both null and undefined values reliably.
